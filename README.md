# 📋 User List with Axios  

## 📌 Objective  
Practice working with **API integration using Axios** in React.  

---

## 🎯 Task  
- Fetch a list of users from an API.  
- Display the users’ **names** and **emails** in a styled list.  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements  
- Use **`useEffect`** to fetch data when the component loads.  
- Use **`useState`** to store and render user data.  
- Show `"Loading..."` text until the data is fetched.  

---

## ⭐ Bonus Features  
- Add a **"Refresh"** button to re-fetch the data on demand.  
- Handle **errors** gracefully if the API fails.  

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **React** (Vite)  
- **Axios** for API calls  
- **CSS** for styling
